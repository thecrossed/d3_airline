project for learning D3

# Description
This project is to help me learn D3, a Javascript package for building interactive data visualization. The content is from the course Information Visualization bundle at Coursera[link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-programming-d3js/home/week/1).

The goal of the data visualization project is to create an interactive dashboard with two charts, with one being a horizontal bar chart showcasing number of flights of each flight company, and another being a geographical map showing the network between each pair of destination and arrival airports.

The project contains four steps, corresponding to four week lessons from the online course.

Step 1 Scaffolding the dashboard with a title and two charts 

Step 2 Preparing the data and building the bar chart

Step 3 Drawing the map and airports

Step 4 Drawing network and adding hover interaction
